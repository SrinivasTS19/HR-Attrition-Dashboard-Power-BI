🔍 Data Analysis in Action: HR Attrition Dashboard 📊

As an aspiring Data Analyst, I recently worked on building a Power BI dashboard focused on analyzing employee attrition trends. This project allowed me to dive into HR data and extract actionable insights that could help organizations boost employee retention and improve workplace satisfaction.

📌 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
▪️ Ensured data completeness by handling missing values
▪️ Standardized fields like job roles and departments
▪️ Structured the data for seamless Power BI integration

📌 Data Modeling & Dashboard Design
▪️ Built an interactive Power BI dashboard exploring attrition by:
  • Job Role & Department
  • Age Group & Gender
  • Monthly Income, Job Satisfaction & Overtime
▪️ Integrated KPI cards, filters, and slicers for deeper insight

📌 Key Business Insights
🔹 Attrition Rate: 12% of employees left
🔹 Top Departments Affected: R&D & Sales
🔹 Overtime Impact: Employees doing overtime showed much higher attrition
🔹 Low Income = High Attrition: Employees below median income were more likely to leave
🔹 Regular Check-ins: Job satisfaction and work-life balance were strong attrition indicators

💡 Takeaway & Learnings
This project helped me understand how HR data can reveal patterns that drive data-driven people strategies. It sharpened my skills in Power BI, data cleaning, and visualization — and reinforced the value of clear, actionable storytelling in analytics.

🚀 Excited to Learn & Connect!
▪️ Designing meaningful HR visuals was a fun challenge!
▪️ Fellow data folks: How do you present HR insights to leadership?
